  "pageHtmlAbout": "<p>SGONE is a tool that tries to find potential duplicates in your data that aren't immediately obvious. This includes errors like typos, different punctuation or differences in upper- and lowercase letters.</p> <p>In short, SGONE will help you make sure your duplicate<strong>S</strong> are <strong>GONE</strong>!</p> <p>To achieve this, SGONE utilises the following appoach:</p> <ul> <li>Remove all non-alphanumeric characters.</li> <li>Convert the text to lowercase.</li> <li>Calculate the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance'>Levenshtein Distance</a> between any pair of identifiers.</li> <li>Calculate a threshold for the distance value based on the average identifier length of the comparison.</li> <li>If the distance is zero, we have an exact match.</li> <li>If the distance is not zero, but below the threshold, check the following:</li> <ul> <li>Is one identifier a substring of the other?</li> <li>Just looking at the numeric values in the identifiers, are they different?</li> <li>If either of these are true, then we're likely not dealing with a duplicate. Otherwise, mark them as potential duplicates.</li> </ul> </ul> <p>The results are presented in tabular form with either an <span class='badge badge-success'>exact</span> or a <span class='badge badge-warning'>likely</span> match tag.</p><p>After finding the pairwise potential duplicates, SGONE can join similar items into groups. This is particularly useful if you want to unify groups of similar items into one. To do so, select the representative/preferred item from each group by clicking on it. The result of this process can directly be imported into <a href='https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate/'>Germinate</a> to unify duplicates.</p>",
